# Alarm-Kivy
An alarm project with a simple GUI and a couple of extra features built using Kivy

The program consists of 2 screens: 

Main screen: This is where you set the time of the alarm.

Second Screen: After you set the time and press the "submit" button, you'll go to the second screen. Here you have your morning routine, a list of the things you have to do during the day, weather information and two buttons that redirect you to Instagram and Youtube, for you to check your updates and play some music in the morning.

The items in both lists come from the .txt files stored in the Texts folder. 
A song will play at the time you set the alarm to (otherwise it wouldn't be much of an alarm, would it?).
The song it's currently played is "Finale" by Madeon, but you can replace it by any mp3 file. Make sure to change the value of the variable "song_name" in the main program, though.

To run this project and all its features, you'll need to have installed:
-Kivy
-Webbrowser
-Playsound
-Requests
-BeautifulSoup
